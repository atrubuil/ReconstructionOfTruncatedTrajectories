# Reconstruction Of Truncated Trajectories
We consider particles trajectories following birth and death processes as well as Browian motion with drift. 
These trajectories are observed on a subregion of the whole surface where particles perform dynamics.
We aim at recognizing if some tracklets (truncated tracks) could be connected through the unobserved region.

Cplex optimizer studio is used to solve the optimization problem. 
User can download it on the website https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer

The codes include two experiments:
1. Simulation of a movie, mimiting MreB particle motions registered by TIRFM microscopie, and the connection result on it.
2. The evaluation of the estimation of parmaters, including birth rate, death rate, arrival rate, speed, diffusion coefficient etc.
